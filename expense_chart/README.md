Hello, there. This is an expense chart made using HTML, CSS and JS. The bars in the chart are interactive. One can over over them to view the amount they represent. 


## What i learned:
* Mouse events. (You know that the addEventListener functions take a third argument also. You can specify how many times you want the event to execute in the third argument.)

* Removing events
* JSON
